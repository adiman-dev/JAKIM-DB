# JAKIM-DB
A prayer time database extracted from JAKIM Malaysia.

##About
Source: [http://www.e-solat.gov.my/](http://www.e-solat.gov.my/)

Data is scrapped with my own custom scrapper. Sorry, scrapper script is too messy to share. I has a shy. 

As we all know, JAKIM only releases their data yearly and the data is obviously full of human error. To have a centralized repo will be a good start. Anybody can take and do correction to the data. 

Anybody is free to download and use this data as their liking. 

##Contents
1. jakim_2015.db : A sqlite db binary. 
2. jakim_2015.sql : A SQLite databse dump file
